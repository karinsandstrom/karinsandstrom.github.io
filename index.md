Welcome to my webpage.  I am currently the Bart J. Bok Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Arizona Department of Astronomy. In Fall 2015, I will start as an assistant professor at University of California, San Diego.  On this page you can find information about my research and, eventually, teaching.
